### Running containers = containerized processes

1. Namespaces

    1.1 Network namespace

    In the first terminal:
        
        docker run -d --name=nginx nginx

    In the second terminal:

        docker run --network container:nginx -it alpine:3.21 /bin/sh

    in the container:

            apk add curl

            curl localhost
        
    and we don't have any nginx running
            
            ps aux
    
    In the third terminal, we can run another container in a new network namespace (and we want it to be a privileged container):

        docker run --privileged -it alpine:3.21 /bin/sh

    In the first terminal:

        docker logs nginx

        docker stop nginx
    
    After stop, if we try again curl it will not work anymore
    
    1.2 Time namespace

    In all the terminals get the current date and time:

        date

    Set a new time in the third terminal:

        date +%T -s "17:10:13"
    
    And again in all the terminals get the current date and time:

        date

2. cgroups and chroot

    - no demos

3. Docker daemon to containerd to runc

    `docker run -it alpine:3.21 /bin/sh` and run `sleep 180` in the container

    `docker run -it --pid=host ubuntu:22.04 /bin/sh` and then inside the container run:

        apt-get update

        apt-get install -y psmisc

        ps -fC sleep #it will allow to the the sleep PID

        pstree -sg sleep_PID

        ps aux | grep docker
